# class-intro
For this first assignment in CS 161, with '@joeparislbcc', we interviewed another student. We were given a list of ideas and talking points, and 10 minutes to talk away. I got a chance to learn a decent amount about the student I met.
The student I got to meet is '@phanquocthang99'. He is from Vietnam, and is visiting here in Oregon for school. Here is a list of somme of the facts I learned about him!
## Things I learned
* He is into movies and video games
* He is a computer science major, and will be transferring to OSU to continue schooling
